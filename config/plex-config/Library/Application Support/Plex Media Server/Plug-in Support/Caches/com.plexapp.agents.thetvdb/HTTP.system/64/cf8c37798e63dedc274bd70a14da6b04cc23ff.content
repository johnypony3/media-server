However, in order to do so, they must first drive across a country that has been largely closed to Westerners for over 40 years: Burma. The trio must make this trip in three trucks that have been bought for a limited budget. Unsurprisingly, they are not quite as the presenters might have hoped or expected…What follows is an epic journey of beautiful scenery, regular adversity, ongoing malfunction, and the constant bickering between the three hosts."
