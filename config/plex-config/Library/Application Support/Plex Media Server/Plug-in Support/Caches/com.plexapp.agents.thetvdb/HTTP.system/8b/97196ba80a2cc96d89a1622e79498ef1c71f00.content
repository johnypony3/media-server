    "overview": "As another day of fantasy plays out in Westworld — a vast, remote park where guests pay top dollar to share wild-west adventures with android “hosts” — top programmer Bernard Lowe alerts park founder Dr. Robert Ford about incidents of aberrant behavior cropping up in some recently re-coded hosts. Meanwhile, in the Westworld town of Sweetwater, a rancher’s daughter named Dolores encounters a gunslinger named Teddy in the street — but their predictable narrative is upended by the appearance of a ruthless Man in Black and, later, by a supporting host’s unscripted encounter with an artifact of the outside world.",
