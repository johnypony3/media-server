He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.\n\nJack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.  \n\nThe Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singerâ€™s preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.\n\nHis blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.\n\nHe currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.\n\nLast.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+White\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
