He has been recognised with a 2016 Grammy Award nomination in the Best Dance/Electronic Album category for his album In Colour. In 2007, Smith joined The xx accompanying old school friends Romy Madley Croft, Oliver Sim, Baria Qureshi from the Elliott School, notable for alumni including Hot Chip, Burial and Four Tet. The band's first album 'xx' was released in August 2009 and went on to become platinum in the UK.\n\nJamie went on to produce a series of remixes of songs by Gil Scott-Heron from his 2010 album I'm New Here. The first remix single 'NY Is Killing Me', credited to Gil Scott-Heron and Jamie xx, aired on radio stations across the UK and Europe in late 2010, followed by 'I'll Take Care Of U' in January 2011. Both singles drew a lot of attention by the public and critics and set the way for a 13-track remix album entitled 'We're New Here', out February 21, 2011 on the XL Recordings label and produced entirely by Jamie xx. 'We're New Here' received very positive critical acclaim and was named \"a masterpiece in its own right\" by BBC's Ele Beattie.\n\nOn June 6th, he released the single 'Far Nearer / Beat For', which was met with strong critical acclaim.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jamie+xx\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
