The album was released on March 16, 2015, by Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and distributed by Interscope Records. Upon its release, To Pimp a Butterfly received rave reviews from music critics. Lamar has described the album, which incorporates elements of funk, spoken word poetry and jazz, as \"honest, fearful and unapologetic.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Kendrick indicated that the title was a play on Harper Lee's novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. He was quoted as saying, \"Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'… It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses — I truly believe that.\"\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score of 95, indicating \"universal acclaim\", based on 13 reviews. Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop gave it a perfect score, making it the third 10/10 he's given to a contemporary album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/To+Pimp+a+Butterfly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
