Their musical sound draws from a wide range of influences (most notably '60s and '70s psychedelic rock) and they like to see themselves as \"a steady flowing psychedelic groove rock band that emphasizes dream-like melody.\"  \n\nThe band signed a worldwide deal with label Modular Recordings in mid 2008, releasing their self titled EP in late 2008 and the single 'Sundown Syndrome' in 2009. Their debut album, \"Innerspeaker\", was released in 2010 to widespread critical acclaim. Their sophomore, \"Lonerism\", was released on October 5th, 2012, again to wide acclaim. Their third album, \"Currents\", followed in the summer of 2015. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
