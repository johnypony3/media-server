After a break from touring for their 2009 debut album xx, the group's members began writing songs individually before recording the album during November 2011 to May 2012. Guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim drew on personal experiences for their songwriting. For Coexist, The xx drew on the electronic dance music that occured when they were away on tour in 2010. It was produced by group member Jamie xx, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.\nThe album was promoted with two singlesâ€”\"Angels\" and \"Chained\". The xx promoted the album with an international tour during June to September 2012. Upon its release, Coexist received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Croft and Sim's performances, Jamie xx's production, and the music's refinement of their sound. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, the group's first number-one album in the United Kingdom. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+xx/Coexist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
