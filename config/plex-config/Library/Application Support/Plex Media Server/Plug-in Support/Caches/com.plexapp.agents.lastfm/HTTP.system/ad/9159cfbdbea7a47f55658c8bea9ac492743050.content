Like the group's previous two albums, Currents was written, recorded, performed, and produced by primary member Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker also mixed the music. It was also the first time that Parker recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborations.\n\nAfter releasing the group's previous record, Lonerism (2012), Parker began work on Currents, largely recording at his home studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and owing to his reputation as a musical auteur, labored over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project's prior work, Currents marks a shift to more dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesizers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala's music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted to be the result of a romantic break-up. The album's cover art depicting vortex shedding is a visualization of these themes.\n\nCurrents was preceded by the singles Let It Happen, Cause I'm a Man, Disciples and Eventually. Like its predecessors, the album received critical acclaim. It became the group's best charting release, debuting at number one in Australia, number three in the United Kingdom, and number four in the United States. At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, Currents was awarded \"Best Rock Album\" and \"Album of the Year\", among other honors that Tame Impala received. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Currents\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
