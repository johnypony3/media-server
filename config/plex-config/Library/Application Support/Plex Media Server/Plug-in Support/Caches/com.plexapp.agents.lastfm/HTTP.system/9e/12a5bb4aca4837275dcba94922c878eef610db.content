Although their previous records had some popular success, they never even hinted at the massive sales of Breakfast in America. Then again, Supertramp's earlier records weren't as pop-oriented as Breakfast. The majority of the album consisted of tightly written, catchy, well-constructed pop songs, like the hits \"The Logical Song,\" \"Take the Long Way Home,\" and \"Goodbye Stranger.\" Supertramp still had a tendency to indulge themselves occasionally, but Breakfast in America had very few weak moments. It was clearly their high-water mark. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Supertramp/Breakfast+In+America\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
